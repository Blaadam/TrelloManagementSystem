# Trello Management System

This application was an application developed in WPF to help with my understanding and learning of making desktop applications. The application has limited functionality and was never completed, allowing users to create short API requests to retrieve specific information. If I was to revisit this application, I would split it into multiple views wuthin a window - allowing seamless migration to different tabs and windows whilst being easibly maintained and improved upon.

For this application, it utilises Microsoft SQL Server to store the credentials of the user, this is not optimal and in the future I would like to move this to use SQLite so the credentials are stored locally rather than being on a main server. In a future development, I would also make it so that users could import/export their credentials as if this was used in a business environment, it could be used to share access to multiple accounts between staff members.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to use this system, especially as it lacks features and is horribly maintainable.
